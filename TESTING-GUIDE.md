| user@globex.test | password | Member | Globex Corp | Free |

### 1.1 **Frontend Login Testing**

**Visit:** http://localhost:3001

**Expected:** Should redirect to login page automatically

**Test Each Account:**
1. **Login with admin@acme.test / password**
   - ‚úÖ Should redirect to dashboard
   - ‚úÖ Should show "Welcome, admin@acme.test (admin) - Acme Corp (pro)"
   - ‚úÖ Should show "Upgrade to Pro" button is NOT visible (already pro)

2. **Logout and Login with user@acme.test / password**
   - ‚úÖ Should redirect to dashboard
   - ‚úÖ Should show "Welcome, user@acme.test (member) - Acme Corp (pro)"
   - ‚úÖ Should NOT show "Upgrade to Pro" button (not admin)

3. **Logout and Login with admin@globex.test / password**
   - ‚úÖ Should redirect to dashboard
   - ‚úÖ Should show "Welcome, admin@globex.test (admin) - Globex Corporation (free)"
   - ‚úÖ Should show "Upgrade to Pro" button (free plan + admin)

   - ‚úÖ Should redirect to dashboard
   - ‚úÖ Should show "Welcome, user@globex.test (member) - Globex Corporation (free)"
   - ‚úÖ Should NOT show "Upgrade to Pro" button (not admin)

### 1.2 **API Authentication Testing**

**Test Invalid Login:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email": "wrong@email.com", "password": "wrongpassword"}'

# Expected: {"error": "Invalid credentials"}
```

**Test Valid Login:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email": "admin@acme.test", "password": "password"}'

# Expected: JSON with user info and JWT token
```

---

## üè¢ **PHASE 2: Multi-Tenant Isolation Testing**

### 2.1 **Data Isolation Verification**

**Login as Acme Admin (admin@acme.test)**
1. Create a note titled "ACME SECRET NOTE"
2. Navigate around, check notes list
3. Remember the note count

**Login as Globex Admin (admin@globex.test)**
1. Check notes list - should NOT see "ACME SECRET NOTE"
2. Create a note titled "GLOBEX CONFIDENTIAL"
3. Verify only Globex notes are visible

**Login back as Acme Admin**
1. Should still see "ACME SECRET NOTE"
2. Should NOT see "GLOBEX CONFIDENTIAL"

‚úÖ **PASS:** Each tenant only sees their own data

### 2.2 **API-Level Isolation Testing**

**Get tokens for both tenants:**
```bash
# Get Acme token
ACME_TOKEN=$(curl -s -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email": "admin@acme.test", "password": "password"}' | jq -r '.token')

# Get Globex token  
GLOBEX_TOKEN=$(curl -s -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email": "admin@globex.test", "password": "password"}' | jq -r '.token')
```

**Test tenant isolation:**
```bash
# Acme notes
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $ACME_TOKEN" http://localhost:3001/api/notes

# Globex notes  
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $GLOBEX_TOKEN" http://localhost:3001/api/notes

# Should return completely different sets of notes
```

---

## üë• **PHASE 3: Role-Based Access Control Testing**

### 3.1 **Admin vs Member Permissions**

**Admin Capabilities (admin@acme.test or admin@globex.test):**
- ‚úÖ Can create, read, update, delete notes
- ‚úÖ Can upgrade tenant subscription
- ‚úÖ Sees "Upgrade to Pro" button (if free plan)

**Member Capabilities (user@acme.test or user@globex.test):**
- ‚úÖ Can create, read, update, delete notes  
- ‚ùå Cannot upgrade tenant subscription
- ‚ùå Does NOT see "Upgrade to Pro" button

### 3.2 **Subscription Upgrade Testing**

**Test 1: Member tries to upgrade (should fail)**
```bash
# Login as member
MEMBER_TOKEN=$(curl -s -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email": "user@globex.test", "password": "password"}' | jq -r '.token')

# Try to upgrade (should fail)
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/tenants/globex/upgrade \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $MEMBER_TOKEN"

# Expected: {"error": "Only admins can upgrade subscriptions"}
```

**Test 2: Admin upgrades successfully**
```bash
# Login as admin
ADMIN_TOKEN=$(curl -s -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email": "admin@globex.test", "password": "password"}' | jq -r '.token')

# Upgrade tenant
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/tenants/globex/upgrade \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_TOKEN"

# Expected: {"message": "Subscription upgraded successfully", ...}
```

## üí≥ **PHASE 4: Subscription Limits Testing**

### 4.1 **Free Plan Limits (3 notes max)**

**Reset Globex to Free Plan:**
1. If Globex was upgraded to Pro in previous tests, you may need to manually reset it
2. Or use a fresh database: `npm run db:seed`

**Test Free Plan Limits:**
1. **Login as admin@globex.test** (should be free plan)
2. **Create Note 1:** Title: "Free Note 1", Content: "Test content 1"
3. **Create Note 2:** Title: "Free Note 2", Content: "Test content 2"  
4. **Create Note 3:** Title: "Free Note 3", Content: "Test content 3"
5. **Try Create Note 4:** Should show error "Free plan is limited to 3 notes. Upgrade to Pro for unlimited notes."

**Frontend Testing:**
- ‚úÖ Notes counter should show "Your Notes (3/3)"
- ‚úÖ "Create Note" button should be disabled or hidden
- ‚úÖ Red warning message should appear about reaching limit
- ‚úÖ "Upgrade to Pro" button should be prominent

### 4.2 **Pro Plan Unlimited**

**Test Pro Plan (Acme or upgraded Globex):**
1. **Login as admin@acme.test** (Pro plan)
2. **Create 5+ notes** - should all work without limits
3. **Notes counter** should show "Your Notes (X)" without "/3" limit
